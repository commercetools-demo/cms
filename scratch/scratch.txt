The assests directory's main.ts currently is exporting one web component called "cms-app". I want to export three more components:              │
   "cms-renderer" and "registry-app" and "registry-components"                                                                                                            │
   change the vite.config.ts accordingly.                                                                                                        │
   what does the "registry-app" do:                                                                                                                  │
   - this component renders a list of all web-component available in cms-app and cms-renderer
   - there are apis available for CRUD operations in registry
   - the endpoints are just like cms-app api calls except instead of /:businussunitkey/custom-object(s) they are /registry
   - the api responses have the same response type ApiResponse<T>
   - the value of T is consist of metadata and deployedUrl.                                      │
   - the metadata should look exactly like the examples we have in components/resgistry.ts file      
   - the deployedUrl    is a url pointing to the place the web-component is deployedUrl                                         │
   what does the "cms-renderer" do:                                                                                                              │
   - have two props, just ike cms-app. baseurl and business-unit-key.                                                                            │
   - have two  additional props: route and key. both are optional but at least one should be provded.                                             │
   - if key is provided the cms-renderer uses the hydratedUrl/custom-object/:key to fetch the page data
   - if the route is provided, it should use the hydratedUrl to get all pages and search for the route and get the page data
   - if   page data is present it should render the page using the same principles of grid we setup in cms-app and the web-components in registry
   - if no page data is found, render nothing. just a warning in console
   - if key or route not provided, show error
   - if web-component is not found, display error    
   Registry-components:
   - one top component exporting all web-components
   - create the sample registry components there
   - the web-component of the registry-components exported should be self sufficient to render with provided props which are defined in     │
   metadata 
   Changes to current cms-app:
   - refactor and move all components related to cms-app to their own folder so we have less files lying around
   - refactor registry.ts to read metadata from the "registry" api.
   
   create reusable components, methods and utils.
